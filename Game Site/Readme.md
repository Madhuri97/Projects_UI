### Research about different semantic tags.
elements with meaning used to define different parts of webpage
some of semantic elements:
header, nav, section, article, aside, footer, main, summary, figure, details, mark 
These tags are implemented in the GameSite 

### Create a new website. The second section need to be 2 column layout in Home page. Have a sticky footer(use postion: fixed).
My concept: GameSite which having all details about the game which i have played
Resources: taken some of images and content from the main page of game site but not code
Home --> header, footer, image, navbar,summary 2-col which consits of game images and content
About --> header, footer, About the game site navbar with the respective game
Characters --> My favorite Games, form to know which is user fav game and why

index.html --> about.html --> characters.html
