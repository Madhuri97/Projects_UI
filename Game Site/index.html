            <summary>Supercell is a mobile game developer based in Helsinki, 
                Finland, with offices in San Francisco, Seoul and 
                Shanghai. Since our launch in 2010, we've brought 
                five games to the global market – Hay Day, Clash of Clans, 
                Boom Beach, Clash Royale and Brawl Stars. Our goal is to 
                make the best games – games that are played by as many people as 
                possible, enjoyed for years and remembered forever.
